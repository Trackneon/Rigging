Hip sockets detached from model
Hip piece not constrained
Hip and Torso controls control the same control groups
Joints not hidden
Right hand not constrained correctly
Missing COG/Transform controls
Most of the controls work as expected. Mostly the hip and spine joints that need some fixing. 
Had to animate hip geo separately since it was not constrained
